# ACC-CS-CLUB-ML
Austin community college computer science club group machine learning project for poker and hidden information games

# Welcome
Welcome to the ACC CS poker ML group projects. Do get started, please read [contributing.md](docs/contributing.md)

# Goals
The goal of NitDestroyer is to find a Nash Equilibrium for poker. We will begin with Rhode Island Hold'em (RIH), and gradually move up to Limit Texas Hold'em (LTH) and No Limit Texas Hold'em (NLTH). We are specifically targeting cash game play, but will also be looking at tournament play.
